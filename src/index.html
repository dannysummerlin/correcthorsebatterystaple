  <h3 class="mb-3">The Idea</h3>
  <p class="lead">We tend to associate secure passwords with complicated and hard-to-remember passwords. But it
    doesn't have to be this way.</p>
  <p>We make password difficult to guess by increasing <em>entropy</em> &mdash; the degree of uncertainty in the
    password. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to guess the password.</p>
  <p>One way of increasing entropy is to make passwords more complicated. Another way is to make the password
    longer, but keeping it simple, as the following xkcd comic shows:</p>
  <a class="d-block" href="https://xkcd.com/936/"
     title="To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.">
    <figure class="figure border rounded p-4 bg-light">
      <img class="figure-img img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png"
           alt="xkcd comic about password strength">
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an
        infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize.

    </figure>
  </a>
  <p>The core idea is that while using a single dictionary as a password is horribly insecure and can be cracked in
    seconds, each additional word makes cracking exponentially harder.</p>

  <p>There is a lot of criticism on the internet about this password scheme. However, most of them fail to get the
    actual point. There are also claims that <code>correcthorsebatterystaple</code> is as secure as a 9 character
    password, which sounds fairly bad. This is true if your 9 character password is truly random, such as
    <code>n98idhi3n</code>, and not say, <code>Tr0ub4d0r</code>. The point is that,
    <code>correcthorsebatterystaple</code> is more memorable than <code>n98idhi3n</code>, for approximately equal
    security. To increase security, we can always add more words.</p>

  <p class="lead"><span class="mark">5 words</span> from the large list, or <span class="mark">6 words</span>
    from the small list is sufficient for all reasonable threats.</p>

  <p>Let us consider the absolute worst case, assuming the attacker knows your password is generated by this site,
    knowing that it has 65 bits of entropy, your password was insecurely hashed, and your enemy has GPUs to run
    <span class="mark">500 billion attempts every second</span>. Even then, this scheme will resist the
    cracking attempt for <code>over a year</code>.</p>

  <p>Now, most attackers can't attack you that fast, and those who could have better things to do than spending a year
    doing nothing but attacking you (unless you possess state secrets or something), so this is more than sufficient for
    your password. In the highly unlikely case that your password need more security than this offers, or perhaps you
    are just paranoid, adding an extra word would make the attack time thousandfold.</p>

  <p class="lead">In practice, most real life systems use secure password hashing algorithms, captchas, and other
    mechanisms to stop password cracking. It is unlikely that your attacker can reach anywhere close to a million
    guesses a second, and so a 4 word password is probably sufficient for most non-critical accounts.</p>
